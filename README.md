## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Build the Mobile Bundle
The mobile app loads a generated bundle from the assets directory.

node bundler.js
```

### 2. Run the Web Server (Optional)
To use the UI in a browser or serve the AI API:
```bash
cd server
npm install
node server.js
```

### 3. Launch the Mobile App
Ensure you have the Expo Go app installed or an emulator ready.
```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo start
```
